What I'm trying to see 
Is there a relationship between Magnitutde of DEG or ASE (either direction so absolute value used)
and the number synonymous or nonysnonymous (or both) fixed differences. 

1. DEG
a. Compare the absolute logFC value with the number of diffs (controlled for gene length)
b. Compare the ratio of nonsyn/syn with absolute logFC value (no need to control)

2. ASE
a. Compare the absolute Log2FC with the number of diffs (controlled for gene length)
b. Compare the ratio of nonsyn/syn with absolute logFC value (no need to control)



JON Meeting Ideas
look at paper and for ASE use 2 response variables.
