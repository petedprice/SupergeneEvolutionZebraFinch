# TO DO 
(1) Check the Pseudohaploid run on the cluster where I've included all individuals for autosomes and 
the proper numbers for the X chromosome. Make plots for this and compare to previous equal As and Bs version
  - This worked so keeping with this method 
(2)Run the not pseudohaploid run on the cluster, this is where it's normal vcfs but only 
selecting the first haplotypes for the females on the X
  - This didn't work very well so not using 
  
(3)Check above and plot and compare to (1) and the equal As and Bs version





(4) Conclude which to use. Potentially just include subset as a supplementary figure as Jake did 
  - We will do this 
  

(5) Check the xGene and NCXG plots
